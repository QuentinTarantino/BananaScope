Created this as I didn't want to to constantly have to change and retype the gamescope parameters when going from my monitor (3440x1440) to my TV (4k)
Not exactly complex but im not a great coder, anymore much more talented than me is free to come and improve the code themselves!

## Resolution list
* 3840x2160 (4k HDR)
* 3840x2160 (4k)
* 3440x1440 (UltraWide 1440p)
* 2560x1440 (1440p HDR)
* 2560x1440 (1440p)
* 1920x1080 (1080p)
* 1280x720p (720p)

> [!WARNING]
