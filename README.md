# dmenu-Gamescope-Resolution-Selector


a dmenu selector for multiple gamescope resolutions currently including:

3840x2160 (4k HDR)

3840x2160 (4k)

3440x1440 (UltraWide 1440p)

2560x1440 (1440p HDR)

2560x1440 (1440p)

1920x1080 (1080p)

1280x720p (720p)


can be used via the file itself but is best used when binded for quick use,

Created this as I didn't want to to constantly have to change and retype the gamescope parameters when going from my monitor (3440x1440) to my TV (4k)

Not exactly complex but im not a great coder, anymore much more talented than me is free to come and improve the code themselves!
